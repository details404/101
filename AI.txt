Installing Ubuntu 22.04.5 in VirtualBox 7.1.10 is a straightforward process. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you through the installation:

### Prerequisites

1. Download VirtualBox: Ensure you have VirtualBox 7.1.10 installed on your system.
2. Download Ubuntu ISO: Visit the [Ubuntu downloads page](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and download the ISO file for Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS.

### Installation Steps

1. Open VirtualBox:
Launch VirtualBox from your applications menu.

2. Create a New Virtual Machine:
- Click on the "New" button.
- Name your VM (e.g., "Ubuntu 22.04.5"), and select "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version.
- Click "Next."

3. Allocate Memory (RAM):
- Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to the VM. A minimum of 2048 MB (2 GB) is recommended for smooth performance. You can allocate more if your system allows.
- Click "Next."

4. Create a Virtual Hard Disk:
- Select "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
- Choose "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" and click "Next."
- Select "Dynamically allocated" for storage on the physical hard disk and click "Next."
- Set the size of the virtual hard disk (20 GB or more is recommended) and click "Create."

5. Configure the Virtual Machine:
- Select your newly created VM and click on "Settings."
- Go to the "Storage" section.
- Click on the empty disk icon under "Controller: IDE," and in the right panel, click on the disk icon next to "Optical Drive."
- Choose "Choose a disk file..." and select the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded.

6. Adjust Other Settings (Optional):
- You can adjust other settings like "Processors" (increase cores for better performance) and "Network" (set it to NAT for internet access).

7. Start the Virtual Machine:
- Click on "Start" to boot the VM.
- It should boot from the Ubuntu ISO, and you will see the Ubuntu welcome screen.

8. Install Ubuntu:




The "Not in a hypervisor" error usually indicates that VirtualBox is unable to run properly because it can't access hardware virtualization features. Here are some troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:

### 1. Enable Hardware Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

- Restart Your Computer: Enter the BIOS/UEFI setup during the boot process (usually by pressing a key like F2, F10, DEL, or ESC, depending on your motherboard).
- Find Virtualization Technology: Look for settings named "Intel VT-x", "Intel Virtualization Technology", "AMD-V", or similar.
- Enable It: Make sure this option is enabled.
- Save and Exit: Save your changes and reboot your system.

### 2. Check Hyper-V Settings (Windows Users)

If you are using Windows, it's possible that Hyper-V is enabled, which can conflict with VirtualBox.

- Disable Hyper-V:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (search for PowerShell, right-click, and select "Run as administrator").
2. Run the following command:
``shell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
``
3. Restart your computer.

### 3. Reinstall VirtualBox

Sometimes a fresh installation can help:

1. Uninstall VirtualBox: Go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program, and uninstall VirtualBox.
2. Download the Latest Version: Visit the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and download the latest version.
3. Install VirtualBox: Run the installer and follow the prompts.

### 4. Check for Conflicting Software

Some software (like Docker, VMware, or certain antivirus programs) can conflict with VirtualBox. If you have any of these installed, try to temporarily disable them or uninstall if necessary.

### 5. Run VirtualBox as Administrator

Try running VirtualBox as an administrator to see if that resolves the issue. Right-click the VirtualBox shortcut and select "Run as administrator".

### 6. Ensure Your System Supports Virtualization

Make sure your processor supports virtualization technology. You can check this on the manufacturer's website.

#### Following These Steps

After trying the above steps, go back to VirtualBox and start the virtual machine again. If you continue to encounter issues, please let me know, and we can troubleshoot further!
